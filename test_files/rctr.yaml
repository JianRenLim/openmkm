# Input file defining the reactor parameters for hetero_ct
# The thermodynamic information of phases and species is supplied in a different file
# This file uses YAML format. YAML is a superset of JSON, so this input file can also 
# be supplied JSON format.
# For any format related questions, refer to YAML documentation.
#
# For quantities that have units, default units are SI. In that case
# just specify the value. Otherwise give the value and units as tuple
# Ex (temp in K) 
# temperature: 950 
# or (temp in C)
# temperature: 950 C
