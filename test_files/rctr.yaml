# For quantities that have units, default units are SI. In that case
# just specify the value. Otherwise give the value and units as tuple
# Ex (temp in K) :
# temperature: 950 
# or (temp in C)
# temperature: 
#   - 950
#   - C

reactor: 
    type: cstr   # Options are cstr, batch, pfr, pfr_0d
    # Each option may require additional keywords specific to that option
    # Some of the subsequent (required) keywords are dependent on reactor type
    # Not all keywords are applicable for all reactors models
    # For consistency, one could specify null as value for keywords that are not required 

    # cstr, pfr_0d, batch use volume and entry gas velocity is cubic units/sec
    # pfr uses area and length and entry gas velocity is in units/sec
