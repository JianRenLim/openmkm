Here compilation of OpenMKM on Windows is documented.

Prerequisites:
NSIS v3.0.4 or greater         (https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download)
CMake v3.15.4 or greater       (https://cmake.org/download/)
Visual Studio 2017 or greater  (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
Git latest version             (https://git-scm.com/download/win)
Scons v3.1.0 or greater

Install the above software packages using the supplied GUI installers. To install scons, python has to be pre-installed.
One easy way to install scons 
1) Install Anaconda 
2) Create a virtural environment
3) Open anaconda command prompt and activate the virtual environment
4) Use "pip install scons" to install scons. 
5) Keep using the same command prompt in the later stages especially when installing Cantera. 
If you are returning later, run step 3 before installing cantera

Dependencies:
Boost 1.67.0 or greater        (https://www.boost.org/users/download/)
Yaml-cpp 0.6.0 or greater      (https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp)
Cantera 2.5		       (https://github.com/mbkumar/cantera omkm branch)	

After installing the dependencies with the help of supplied documentation, use the following steps to install OpenMKM.
1) Download OpenMKM from https://github.com/vlachosgroup/openmkm using git or download the zip file.
2) (Unzip if zipfile is downloaded and then) Switch to the OpenMKM directory.
3) Create a build folder and switch to the newly created build directory.
4) Run the following command
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A "x64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS="OFF" ^
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="package" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR="bin" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SBINDIR="bin" ^
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBEXECDIR="bin" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR="lib" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR="include" ^
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_OLDINCLUDEDIR="include" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR="share" ^
-DCMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY="ON" -Wno-dev ^
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="C:\Boost\Release"  ^
-DUSE_EXTERNAL_YAML_CPP=True -DYAML_CPP_PREFIX="C:\Program Files (x86)\YAML_CPP" ^
-DCANTERA_PREFIX="C:\Users\<user>\cantera\install_dir"  ^
C:\Users\mbkumar\.conan\data\openmkm\0.3\dei\vklab\source\src 

In the above command, Boost is installed at C:\Boost\Release, yaml-cpp is installed at "C:\Program Files (x86)\YAML_CPP"
 and Cantera is installed at "C:\Users\<user>\cantera\install_dir".
5) Open the newly created file with .sln extension in Visual Studio
6) Build the omkm project. 
7) If there is an error, right clock on omkm project, select Properties, go to Linker->Input and edit the Additional Depedencies variable
to point to the correct libraries. Particularly change cantera_shared.lib to cantera.lib.
