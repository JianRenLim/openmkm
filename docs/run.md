## Running OpenMKM
When OpenMKM is installed and compiled by following the [instructions](install), *omkm* executable
is generated. Copy the *omkm* executable file to the simulation folder.
*omkm* executable requires two input files, which are specified as arguments in the command line. 
The first argument is the name of yaml file specifying the reactor model parameters, and the second argument
is the name of Cantera XML input file, which provides the definitions of species, reactions, interactions. 
Instructions on how to write or generate your own input files can be found on Input section in the navigation panel.
For the purpose of this tutorial, you can grab these files from any of the simulations folders in the 
\<OpenMKM\_ROOT\>/examples folder.
 Once the three files are in the simulation folder, run the simulation with the following command:

~~~ bash
./omkm <rctr.yaml> <input.xml>
~~~

After execution, OpenMKM produces numerous output files listing various quantities of interest, such 
as mole fractions, surface coverages either as a function of time for batch and CSTR's or as a function
of distance from inlet for PFR. Details about the output files generated by OpenMKM and their information
is given in Output section in the navigation panel.
