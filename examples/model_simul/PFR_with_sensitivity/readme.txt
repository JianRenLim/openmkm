Plug flow reactor is modeled and sensitivity coefficients are calculated simultaneously.

The reactions for which sensitivity coefficients are calculated are listed under sensitivity keyword.

The output file 1d_pfr_sensitivity.out lists the sensitivity coefficients of the state variables, gas mass fractions and surface coverages w.r.t. the reactions. Each row corresponds to one reaction and the columns represent the state variables, ...

If the values are separated by commas, use pandas.read_csv function to load the data into python.
